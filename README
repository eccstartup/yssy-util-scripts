upload: a bash script to upload file to bbs.sjtu.edu.cn

[root@exaatto ~]# upload -h
USAGE: upload BOARD FILE [FILE ...]
upload FILE to BOARD@bbs.sjtu.edu.cn
  -h display this help

This script uses curl(1) to handle the HTTP mess, and uses grep(1) to "parse" the HTML (god bless it) responses.
This script uses ~/.config/bbs_upload to store cookies, you can also provide a *plain text* passwd file in that directory, such as:
[root@exaatto ~]# cat ~/.config/bbs_upload/passwd
username:password

If the passwd file doesn't exist or is empty, this script would prompt for your ID and password. Since your password would be stored in plain text without any protection, it's *NOT* recommended to use the passwd file.

This script prints url to stdout, infomations to stderr and returns count of files successfully uploaded.
